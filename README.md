This repository contains my daily solutions for Advent of Code 2025. Each solution is written with clarity, structure, and problem-solving in mind, reflecting a consistent approach to improving coding skills.

## Structure

The project is organized by days. Each folder corresponds to a specific challenge.

```
Advent_of_Code_2025/
│
├── day01/
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── notes.md
│
├── day02/
│   ├── input.txt
│   ├── solution.py
│   └── notes.md
│
└── ...
```

You can adapt this structure as needed for additional languages, tests, or utilities.

## Goals

- Strengthen problem-solving skills through daily coding challenges
- Practice clean, readable code with an emphasis on logic
- Track progress throughout the Advent of Code 2025 event
- Build a consistent habit of solving algorithmic problems

## How to Run

Navigate to the desired day and execute the solution file.

Example:

```
cd day01
python solution.py
```

If you are using a different language or environment, adjust the commands accordingly.

## Notes

Each day may include a notes.md file documenting the approach, challenges faced, and insights gained. This supports long-term learning and better understanding of patterns across problems.
